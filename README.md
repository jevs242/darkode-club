## ðŸ“– Project Experience

**Darkode Club** was created as part of a **Game Jam**, developed by a team of five within the span of just **one week**. It was my **first time participating in a game jam**, and I took on the role of the **sole programmer** for the entire project.

During development, I:
- Built the game entirely in **Unreal Engine 4** using **C++** and **Blueprints**
- Learned to **integrate C++ with Blueprints** efficiently under time pressure
- Gained practical experience in **collider logic** and **level design**
- Optimized workflow and improved my **rapid development skills**

This experience pushed me to work fast and smart, taught me a lot about teamwork, and significantly boosted my Unreal Engine skillset. The project was a success â€” **we won second place** in the jam, and the game was later released on **Itch.io**.

Enjoy exploring the project! ðŸŽ®ðŸ”¥
